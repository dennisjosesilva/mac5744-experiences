# mac5744-experiences
Code based on the course MAC5744 - Introduction to Computer Graphics Activities in C++

This repository is based on https://github.com/mjck/mac420 which was developed to support practice activities of 
the course MAC5744 - Introduction to Computer Graphics from Institute of Mathematics and Statistics of the 
University of Sao Paulo which I am taking. I want to put some code developed in some activities developed in the course using OpenGL and C++ instead of Python as presented in the course. I may also change some of the functionalities of the original source as I want to test new things.
